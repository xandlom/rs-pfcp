| **Node Report Response** | 4-5 | Medium | Cause + offending IE + optional node ID |
| **Session Deletion Response** | 5-7 | Medium | Cause + optional usage reports + offending IE |

#### **Low Priority for Builder Pattern** (Simple Messages)
| Message Type | Fields | Complexity | Reason | Status |
|--------------|---------|------------|---------|---------|
| ~~**Heartbeat Request**~~ | 2-3 | Low | Optional recovery timestamp and IP | ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** |
| ~~**Heartbeat Response**~~ | 2-3 | Low | Optional recovery timestamp | ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** |
| ~~**Association Release Request**~~ | 1-2 | Low | Required node ID | ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** |
| ~~**Association Release Response**~~ | 2-3 | Low | Required cause and node ID | ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** |
| ~~**Version Not Supported Response**~~ | 1-2 | Low | Minimal error response with optional IEs | ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** |
| **Session Set Deletion Request** | 2-4 | Low-Medium | Node ID + optional IEs | ‚ùå Pending |
| **Session Set Deletion Response** | 2-4 | Low-Medium | Cause + optional offending IE | ‚ùå Pending |

## Analysis by PFCP Message Categories

### **Session Messages** (8 total, 3 with builders = 38%)
Session messages are the most complex, dealing with PDR/FAR/QER/URR creation and management.

**‚úÖ Have Builders:** Session Establishment Request/Response, Session Modification Request, Session Report Request/Response

**‚ùå Missing Builders:** Session Modification Response, Session Deletion Request/Response

### **Association Messages** (8 total, 2 with builders = 25%)
Association messages handle CP-UP function relationships and capabilities exchange.

**‚úÖ Have Builders:** Association Release Request/Response  
**‚ùå Missing Builders:** Association Setup Request/Response, Association Update Request/Response

### **Node Messages** (4 total, 2 with builders = 50%)
Node-level reporting and management messages.

**‚úÖ Have Builders:** Heartbeat Request/Response
**‚ùå Missing Builders:** Node Report Request/Response

### **PFD Messages** (2 total, 0 with builders = 0%)
Packet Flow Description management for application traffic detection.

**‚ùå Missing Builders:** PFD Management Request/Response

### **Utility Messages** (3 total, 1 with builders = 33%)
Error handling and session set operations.

**‚úÖ Have Builders:** Version Not Supported Response  
**‚ùå Missing Builders:** Session Set Deletion Request/Response

## Recommendations

### **Phase 1: High-Impact Complex Messages**
Implement builders for these complex messages that would significantly benefit from the pattern:

1. **Session Modification Response** - Complex response with multiple created/updated IEs
2. **PFD Management Request** - Application detection rule management
3. **Session Deletion Request** - Session teardown with optional context
4. **PFD Management Response** - Response handling for traffic detection rules

### **Phase 2: Association Management**
Complete association message builders for better API ergonomics:

1. **Association Setup Request/Response** - CP-UP function establishment
2. **Association Update Request/Response** - Capability updates
3. **Node Report Request/Response** - Node-level reporting

### **Phase 3: Remaining Messages**
Add builders for remaining messages for API consistency:

1. **Session Deletion Response**
2. **Session Set Deletion Request/Response**
3. ~~Simple messages (Heartbeat, Release) for API uniformity~~ ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**

## Builder Pattern Benefits

### **For Complex Messages (10+ fields)**
- **Ergonomic API**: Fluent interface for complex message construction
- **Validation**: Built-in validation of mandatory vs optional IEs
- **Maintainability**: Easy to extend with new IEs as protocol evolves
- **Type Safety**: Compile-time validation of message structure

### **For Simple Messages (2-5 fields)**
- **API Consistency**: Uniform interface across all message types
- **Future-Proofing**: Easy extension when new optional IEs are added
- **Documentation**: Self-documenting APIs with builder method names

## Implementation Priority

**Current Coverage: 43% (10/23 messages)** üéØ **+21% improvement!**

**Recommended Target: 100% (23/23 messages)** for complete API consistency

**Recently Completed (Phase 3):** ‚úÖ
1. ~~Heartbeat Request/Response~~ - Simple node management messages
2. ~~Association Release Request/Response~~ - Simple association termination  
3. ~~Version Not Supported Response~~ - Error handling message

**Next Quick Wins:**
1. Session Modification Response (high complexity, missing builder)
2. PFD Management Request/Response (high complexity, missing builders)
3. Association Setup Request/Response (medium complexity, frequently used)

Implementing builders for all message types would create a consistent, ergonomic API that scales well as the PFCP protocol evolves and new IEs are added to existing messages.

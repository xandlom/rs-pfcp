## Analysis by PFCP Message Categories

### **Session Messages** (8 total, 8 with builders = 100%)
Session messages are the most complex, dealing with PDR/FAR/QER/URR creation and management.

**‚úÖ Have Builders:** Session Establishment Request/Response, Session Modification Request/Response, Session Report Request/Response, Session Deletion Request/Response

**‚ùå Missing Builders:** None

### **Association Messages** (8 total, 8 with builders = 100%)
Association messages handle CP-UP function relationships and capabilities exchange.

**‚úÖ Have Builders:** Association Release Request/Response, Association Setup Request/Response, Association Update Request/Response  
**‚ùå Missing Builders:** None

### **Node Messages** (4 total, 4 with builders = 100%)
Node-level reporting and management messages.

**‚úÖ Have Builders:** Heartbeat Request/Response, Node Report Request/Response  
**‚ùå Missing Builders:** None

### **PFD Messages** (2 total, 2 with builders = 100%)
Packet Flow Description management for application traffic detection.

**‚úÖ Have Builders:** PFD Management Request/Response  
**‚ùå Missing Builders:** None

### **Utility Messages** (3 total, 1 with builders = 33%)
Error handling and session set operations.

**‚úÖ Have Builders:** Version Not Supported Response  
**‚ùå Missing Builders:** Session Set Deletion Request/Response

## Recommendations

### **Phase 1: High-Impact Complex Messages**
Implement builders for these complex messages that would significantly benefit from the pattern:

1. **Session Modification Response** - Complex response with multiple created/updated IEs
2. ~~**PFD Management Request**~~ - Application detection rule management ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
3. **Session Deletion Request** - Session teardown with optional context
4. ~~**PFD Management Response**~~ - Response handling for traffic detection rules ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**

### **Phase 2: Association Management**
Complete association message builders for better API ergonomics:

1. **Association Setup Request/Response** - CP-UP function establishment
2. **Association Update Request/Response** - Capability updates
3. **Node Report Request/Response** - Node-level reporting

### **Phase 3: Remaining Messages**
Add builders for remaining messages for API consistency:

1. **Session Deletion Response**
2. **Session Set Deletion Request/Response**
3. ~~Simple messages (Heartbeat, Release) for API uniformity~~ ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**

## Builder Pattern Benefits

### **For Complex Messages (10+ fields)**
- **Ergonomic API**: Fluent interface for complex message construction
- **Validation**: Built-in validation of mandatory vs optional IEs
- **Maintainability**: Easy to extend with new IEs as protocol evolves
- **Type Safety**: Compile-time validation of message structure

### **For Simple Messages (2-5 fields)**
- **API Consistency**: Uniform interface across all message types
- **Future-Proofing**: Easy extension when new optional IEs are added
- **Documentation**: Self-documenting APIs with builder method names

## Implementation Priority

**Current Coverage: 87% (20/23 messages)** üéØ **+65% improvement!**

**Recommended Target: 100% (23/23 messages)** for complete API consistency

**Recently Completed (Phase 1 High Priority):** ‚úÖ
1. ~~PFD Management Request~~ - Complex traffic detection rule management
2. ~~PFD Management Response~~ - Advanced error handling with offending IE support
3. ~~Session Modification Response~~ - Complex response with multiple created/updated IEs
4. ~~Session Deletion Request~~ - Session teardown with optional context + URR collections
5. ~~Session Deletion Response~~ - Response handling with cause + optional offending IE

**Previously Completed (Phase 3):** ‚úÖ
1. ~~Heartbeat Request/Response~~ - Simple node management messages
2. ~~Association Release Request/Response~~ - Simple association termination  
3. ~~Version Not Supported Response~~ - Error handling message

**Next High Priority Targets:**
1. ~~Association Setup Request/Response~~ ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** (medium complexity, frequently used)
2. ~~Association Update Request/Response~~ ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** (medium complexity)
3. ~~Node Report Request/Response~~ ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** (medium complexity, node-level reporting)

Implementing builders for all message types would create a consistent, ergonomic API that scales well as the PFCP protocol evolves and new IEs are added to existing messages.

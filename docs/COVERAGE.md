# Code Coverage Report

**Last Updated**: 2025-10-18
**Overall Coverage**: **74.83%** (6,527/8,723 lines) ⬆️ +7.19%
**Tests**: 911 comprehensive tests (+13 new)
**Goal**: 80% coverage

## Summary

rs-pfcp maintains good test coverage across most components, with particularly strong coverage in core Information Elements. The main gaps are in session message builders and display implementations.

## Coverage by Component

| Component | Coverage | Lines Covered | Status |
|-----------|----------|---------------|--------|
| IE Simple | 95%+ | ~2,500 lines | ✅ Excellent |
| IE Composite | 85%+ | ~1,800 lines | ✅ Good |
| IE Grouped | 75%+ | ~1,200 lines | ⚠️ Fair |
| Messages Core | 60% | ~800 lines | ⚠️ Fair |
| **Messages Session** | **45%** | **~900/2,000** | ⚠️ **Improved** |
| Display | 0% | 0/740 | ❌ Not Tested |
| **Total** | **74.83%** | **6,527/8,723** | ✅ **Near Goal** |

## Critical Coverage Gaps

### Priority 1: Session Operations (0% coverage)

These are the **most critical** files to improve:

```
❌ session_establishment_request.rs    0/271 lines (0%)
❌ session_establishment_response.rs   0/143 lines (0%)
❌ session_modification_request.rs     0/396 lines (0%)
❌ session_report_response.rs          0/159 lines (0%)
```

**Impact**: These are core PFCP operations. Zero coverage is a significant quality risk.

**Action Items**:
1. Add builder pattern tests
2. Add marshal/unmarshal round-trip tests
3. Test validation logic
4. Test error cases

### Priority 2: Display Implementations (0% coverage)

```
❌ message/display.rs    0/740 lines (0%)
```

**Impact**: Display code is used for debugging and logging.

**Action Items**:
1. Add Display trait tests
2. Add Debug trait tests
3. Test YAML/JSON formatting
4. Test edge cases (empty messages, etc.)

### Priority 3: Update Operations ✅ **IMPROVED**

```
✅ update_bar.rs                       13/28 lines (~46%) ⬆️ NEW TESTS
⚠️ update_urr.rs                       101/144 lines (70%)
⚠️ update_forwarding_parameters.rs    58/76 lines (76%)
⚠️ update_pdr.rs                       88/101 lines (87%)
```

**Recent Improvements**:
- ✅ Update BAR: 0% → 46% (+13 comprehensive tests)

**Remaining Action Items**:
1. ~~Add Update BAR tests~~ ✅ **DONE**
2. Complete Update URR builder tests
3. Test forwarding parameter validation

## Coverage Goals

### Short Term (Next Release)

**Target: 75% overall**

Priority actions:
1. **Session Establishment**: 0% → 80% (add ~220 test lines)
2. **Session Modification**: 0% → 80% (add ~320 test lines)
3. **Display**: 0% → 50% (add ~370 test lines)
4. **Update BAR**: 0% → 80% (add ~25 test lines)

**Estimated effort**: ~935 lines of test code

### Medium Term

**Target: 80% overall**

1. Complete all session operations (80%+)
2. Full display coverage (80%+)
3. All update operations (85%+)
4. Integration test scenarios

### Long Term

**Target: 85% overall**

1. All message types (90%+)
2. All IE types (95%+)
3. Edge case coverage
4. Performance-critical path coverage

## How to Improve Coverage

### Running Coverage Locally

```bash
# Generate coverage report
cargo tarpaulin --lib --out Html --output-dir target/coverage

# Open report
xdg-open target/coverage/index.html  # Linux
open target/coverage/index.html      # macOS
```

### Finding Uncovered Code

```bash
# List files with 0% coverage
cargo tarpaulin --lib --verbose 2>&1 | grep " 0/"

# Files with <50% coverage
cargo tarpaulin --lib --verbose 2>&1 | grep -E " [0-4][0-9]/"
```

### Adding Tests

See [Coverage Guide](guides/coverage.md) for detailed instructions on:
- Identifying coverage gaps
- Writing effective tests
- Testing session operations
- Testing display implementations

## CI Integration

Coverage runs automatically on every push and PR:

- ✅ **Minimum**: 60% for CI to pass
- ⚠️ **Warning**: If coverage decreases
- 📊 **Reports**: Available in GitHub Actions artifacts

See `.github/workflows/coverage.yml` for details.

## Coverage Exclusions

Some code is intentionally excluded from coverage:

1. **Test code**: `#[cfg(test)]` modules
2. **Debug code**: Debug-only implementations
3. **Unreachable**: Error paths that can't occur
4. **Platform-specific**: OS-specific code

## Contributing

When adding new code:

1. ✅ **Write tests first** (TDD recommended)
2. ✅ **Maintain coverage**: Don't decrease overall percentage
3. ✅ **Test critical paths**: Session operations require 80%+
4. ✅ **Include round-trip tests**: Marshal/unmarshal validation
5. ✅ **Document untested code**: Explain why if <60%

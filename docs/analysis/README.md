## Completed Analysis

### [Zero-Length IE Analysis](completed/zero-length-ie-analysis.md)
**Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETE (Priority 1)
**Date**: 2025-01-08

Security analysis of zero-length Information Element handling:
- DoS attack vector identification
- Protocol-level protection implementation
- 3GPP TS 29.244 compliance verification
- Test coverage for security hardening

**Outcome**: Protocol-level rejection of zero-length IEs implemented with allowlist for 3 legitimate cases.

### [Builder Pattern Analysis](completed/builder-pattern-analysis.md)
**Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETE
**Date**: Multiple phases

Comprehensive analysis of builder pattern needs across all PFCP messages:
- All 25 message types evaluated
- Complexity assessment
- Implementation priority ranking

**Outcome**: 100% builder pattern coverage achieved for all messages.

### [Builder Pattern Enhancement Plan](completed/builder-pattern-plan.md)
**Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETE
**Date**: Multiple phases

Detailed implementation plan for Information Element builders:
- F-TEID Builder (DONE)
- PDI Builder (DONE)
- CreatePdr/Far/Qer/Urr Builders (DONE)
- UpdatePdr/Far/Qer/Urr Builders (DONE)

**Outcome**: Comprehensive builder pattern implementation with validation and convenience methods.

### [Usage Report Analysis](completed/usage-report-analysis.md)
**Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETE
**Date**: Early development

Analysis of missing IEs for UsageReport implementation:
- Comparison with go-pfcp reference
- 3GPP TS 29.244 specification mapping
- Priority-based implementation plan

**Outcome**: All critical usage reporting IEs implemented.

## Ongoing Work

### [Zero-Length IE Validation](ongoing/zero-length-ie-validation.md)
**Status**: üîÑ IN PROGRESS (Priority 2)
**Current Phase**: High-priority IEs complete (15/15), Remove IEs complete (4/4)

Comprehensive IE-specific validation enhancement:
- 113 IE modules being audited
- Minimum length validation for all IEs
- Descriptive error messages
- Test coverage expansion

**Progress**:
- ‚úÖ Phase 1: Protocol-level protection (COMPLETE)
- üîÑ Phase 2: IE-specific validation (IN PROGRESS)
  - ‚úÖ High-priority core session IEs (15/15 complete)
  - ‚úÖ Remove IEs (4/4 complete)
  - ‚è≥ Medium-priority grouped IEs (ongoing)
  - ‚è≥ Lower-priority IEs (planned)

**Next Steps**:
- Continue medium-priority grouped IEs validation
- Add validation to lower-priority IEs
- Document minimum lengths from 3GPP TS 29.244

## Document Lifecycle

### From Active to Archived

Documents move from `ongoing/` to `completed/` when:
1. ‚úÖ Implementation is finished
2. ‚úÖ Tests are passing
3. ‚úÖ Documentation is updated
4. ‚úÖ Code is merged to main branch
5. ‚úÖ Feature is released

### Document Standards

#### Completed Documents
- Clear completion status and date
- Outcome summary
- Links to implemented code
- Test coverage information
- Lessons learned (if applicable)

#### Ongoing Documents
- Current status section
- Progress tracking (checkboxes)
- Clear next steps
- Ownership/assignee (if applicable)
- Regular updates (date stamps)

## Creating New Analysis Documents

When starting new research or planning:

1. **Create in `ongoing/`** with descriptive name
2. **Include sections**:
   - Overview/Goal
   - Current State Analysis
   - Proposed Approach
   - Implementation Plan
   - Success Criteria
   - Timeline (if applicable)
3. **Update this README** with link and description
4. **Link from relevant docs** (if applicable)

## Using These Documents

### For Contributors
- Review completed analyses to understand design decisions
- Check ongoing work to avoid duplication
- Reference analyses when proposing new features

### For Maintainers
- Archive completed work to keep repository organized
- Update ongoing documents with progress
- Use analyses to guide roadmap planning

### For AI Assistants
- Completed analyses document historical context
- Ongoing work shows current priorities
- Both inform development decisions
